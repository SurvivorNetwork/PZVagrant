# Configuration overrides. Check the Vagrantfile for option keys, for now.

# TODO: PZV should consume standard servertest.ini files and generate a "production copy" - the default servertest.ini
#       file provided by the game server should provide the base settings, which should then overlayed with a 
#       user-provided ini if it exists, then environment variables (Nested TODO: does dotenv have a ruby library?), and
#       finally overrides from this file. After processing the resulting configuration and making necessary
#       adjustments, PZV should produce the final game configuration servertest.ini file in /vagrant/server and
#       sym-link (or sync/copy, since host/guest symlinks seem so buggy) it into the appropriate directory.
#
# Ex:
#pzv_config[ "visibility" ]      = "lan"
#pzv_config[ "steam" ]           = true
#pzv_config[ "memory" ]	         = 2048
#pzv_config[ "pz_memory" ]       = 1600
#pzv_config[ "autorun" ]         = false
#pzv_config[ "serve_from_host" ] = true
